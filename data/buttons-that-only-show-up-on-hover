### Buttons that only show up on hover

Be mindful of a pattern where buttons are hidden and only get displayed when parent element is hovered: this can make the buttons inaccessible from keyboard. instead us using `display:none` of `visibility:none`, consider using alternative methods, e.g. using `position: absolute` and pushing it off the screen.
